For easy access to icingaweb2 you can do following:

    kubectl port-forward svc/{{ .Release.Name }}-icingaweb2 -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} 8080:8080

Open the browser on http://localhost:8080 to access icingaweb2.

Afterwards you will be asked to login. The username is always icingaadmin

In case you didn't define a password in the helm installation a random password will be generated. You can find the password by running:

    kubectl get secret icingaweb2 -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} -o jsonpath='{.data.auth_password}' | base64 -d
